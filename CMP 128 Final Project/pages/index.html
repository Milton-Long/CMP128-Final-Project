        <h1>International Conference in Cloud Computing</h1>
        <h2>July 15-16 | Bronx NY | Virtual + Onsite</h2>

        <h4>About the Computing Conference</h4>
        <p>
            This is the first annual Cloud Computing Conference at Lehman College. The Conference
            series will feature keynote talks, special sessions, poster presentation, tutorials,
            workshops, and contributed papers.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of the conference is to be a premier venue for researchers and industry
            practitioners to share new ideas, research results and development experiences in 
            various fields. This will be one of a kind in the Bronx.
        </p>

            Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, from applications
            to storage and processing power. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve
            coherence and economies of scale. Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud 
            computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. 
            Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications
            up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it
            enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable 
            demand, providing the burst computing capability: high computing power at certain periods
            of peak demand.

            Hello, my name is Milton Long, I am a Computer Science transfer student from <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/">BMCC</a>. I am in my final semester here at Lehman, so I have 
            taken a few programming courses. My first interaction with programming was after I graduated Highschool, I did a work-
             study program, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/yearupnynj/">Year up</a>, that taught me HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have taken Intro to programming one and two where I learned
             java, I've also taken Data structures and algorithms where I learned the pivital concepts of computer science from arrays to linked lists
              to stacks, queues, binary trees, hashtables, and sorting algorithms from bubble sort to quicksort. I've also
             taken an Assembly course where I learned the basics of x86 Assembly.
        </p>
